"""
Thought we might need something cleverer but simply loop through the grid and DFS the trails.
Since we are only ever looking for neighbours with "N+1" the decision space never branches too much
so just counting all the trails works fine.
PArt 2 actually easier than aprt 1 - switch from sets to lists.
